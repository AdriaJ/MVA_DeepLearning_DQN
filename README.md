## Course assignment - Deep Reinforcement Learning


I provided both the configuration files (i.e. the computed weights for each model) and the video produced during the homework. The videos won't play on the notebook but all the videos listed in the notebook are present here.

I have answered the questions and additionally added some remarks at some points in the document.

I stay at your disposal for any information or missing part in the assignment.
